# Welcome to RPL Avionics
[RPL_Avionics](https://github.com/ptbrown35/RPL_Avionics) is the avionics repository for the Rocket Propulsion Laboratory at the University of California, San Diego.

## Projects
Find ongoing projects or create a new one under the projects folder. Make sure to use the tags and trunk directory standard (yeah I know it's more of an SVN thing but I like it). Use the **trunk** as the working directory. Use **tags** titled with the revision number (i.e. "RIO_Rev1") in order to push the trunk to a completed revision (under folder). Use subfolders "docs," "BOM," etc. as needed for the project.
* [RIO](https://github.com/ptbrown35/RPL_Avionics/tree/master/projects/RIO): Remote Input/Output controller for Launchy
